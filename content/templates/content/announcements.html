{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% comment %} A full list of announcements is available with {{ announcements }}
Each announcement has title, time, author, and content
Get each one with something like
{% for a in announcements %}
here, {{ a }} is an announcement.  You can't use it directly.
You can print the title with {{ a.title }}
etc
The content may already contain html or even django tags, so we should use {% autoescape off %}{% endautoescape %}
{% endfor %} {% endcomment %}


{% block title %}{% endblock %}

{% for a in announcements %}

{{ a.title }}

{% autoescape off %}
{{ a.content }}
{% endautoescape %}

{% endfor %}
